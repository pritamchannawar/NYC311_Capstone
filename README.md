# Introduction:
Since it started in March 2003, the New York City (NYC) 311 call line (and more recently its website and app) has let people ask for help with non-emergency government services. People in New York can call 311 to ask for information or to let the government know about a problem that needs fixing. Every time someone calls 311 for help, the request is sorted into one of 278 different types of complaints, this helps the city know what kinds of issues people need help with. These NYC311 data is updated daily and contains information about more than 24 million service requests made since 2010. There are different departments to solve the different requests, although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase impact the agency's overall efficiency. This paper discusses my process for exploring trends in a recent subset of the data (March-Oct. 2023), and for building a Machine learning and deep learning model which will help Agencies improve service delivery by allowing them to focus on their core missions and manage their workload efficiently.
